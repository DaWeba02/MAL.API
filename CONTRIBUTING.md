# Contributing to Font Awesome

Looking to contribute something to MAL.API? **Here's how you can help.**

## Quick start

We only accept issues that are bug reports or feature requests.
Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems that we can fix within the MAL.API core.

* [Submit a bug report](https://github.com/DaWeba02/MAL.API/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&title=Bug%3A+)
* [Request a new feature](https://github.com/DaWeba02/MAL.API/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&title=Feature+request%3A+)

## Pull requests

- Pull requests that do not solve an existing issue are essentially un-prioritized–don't expect these to be addressed quickly
- Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes–keep them simple and small
